# BasicDatabase-Unreal
Simple wrapped DB API for json flatfile database &amp; potentially more backends.

Not meant to be space or speed optimal, but instead to integrate well with diffed text based source control systems (e.g. git) for simplified early development. Ideally this plugin will later have a conversion system to convert storage to something more production ready such as sqlite3 and support something like json diffs.

*Not yet functional* see: https://github.com/getnamo/BasicDatabase-Unreal/issues/1 for progress.
